    "**Answer: **Decision tree, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbours. \n",
    "1. Decision tree is a method that continuously split the dataset by asking 'questions'. It can be used in predicting survial of passengers on the Titanic, predict boston house prices, etc(both classification and regression). The advantage is that it is very simple to understand and interpret because trees can be visualised. The staff in school will be happy to see which feature is important and which is not. Another advantage is that trees can handle both numerical variables and categorical variables. There are both numerical features(like age) and categorical features(like Pstatus), so if we are using decision tree. We can directly handle these data without converting categorical features to dummy variables. The other advantage is that the cost of using the tree is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree. We don't have very rich resource in this problem, so we also care about cost of training and predicting. The cost of trees should not be big. The downside of decision tree is that it can easily overfit the train dataset if we have not carefully control the complexity. Therefore, if we do not carefully tune the model, the accuracy may not be perfect. Also, decision tree is not stable if data varies. If our data is not perfect to do generalization, the variance of our model can be large. We can use ensemble tree-based model to overcome this weakness, but as we don't have enough resource, I would still go with decision trees. \n",
    "2. Support vector machine is a method to maximum the maximize the margin. The general application is 2-class classification like the Titanic survial problem. The main advantage of support vector machine is its flexibility. It can choose its kernel, so the decision boundary can be linear or non-linear, which is flexible. Therefore, it is effective in high dimensional spaces. We have 48 features which is not small. Support vector machine can handle so many dimensions and so it will give a better accuracy. Also with appropriate choices of C and gamma, it can also kind of control the complexity. Another advantage is support vector machine uses a subset of training points in the decision function, so it is also memory efficient. The limitation is that it is hard to train very large dataset, and also it seems that SVM cannot be applied to multi-class problem, but since our model is a 2-class problem and also only has a relative small dataset, so I will conclude that support vector machine is appropriate for our problem. Also, another downside is that if we want to use SVM, the model's performance will greatly depend on choice of kernel, C, and gamma. Tuning these parameters can be demanding. \n",
    "3. K-NN is an instance-based learning algorithm. The general application can be predicting the prices of houses, pridict Titanic survial, etc(both regression and classification). The advantage is that it is simple, and take O(1) to train the model. Therefore, it can handle large training data. Since we really want to train the model fast to save our resources, it will be good to train the model in constant time. Also, the prediction result will always be consistent since we are using instance-based model. This is good because the staff will not want to see different results for the same students while predicting a couple of times. Another advantage is that KNN is robust to noisy data if we choose an appropriate K. This is a very good property because some students in the training dataset may not be representative or there are other features other than the features we use affecting their graduating or not. We will be happy that our model is robust to these instances. The main weakness is KNN will take more time in predicting because it has to compute the distances, so it is hard to cope with very test data, but since we are dealing with relative small dataset, it is fine. Another weakness is we have to choose K and the distance we use. The performance of our model will be highly affected by these parameters.  \n",
    "Therefore, these three model all have their advantages on our problem. They all can handle 2-class classification problem. Also, the size of our dataset will not be a problem. The performance and cost of these models should all be OK, so I think they are appropriate. \n"

    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",

    "**Answer: ** I will choose the third model--K-Nearest Neighbours. Based on our results, the support vector machine is the best at F1 score on test dataset, but it will take much longer time to train the model than K-nearest neighbours method, which in turn means much more cost. K-nearest Neighbours method is only a little bit worse than Support vector machine at F1 score. The difference is only about 0.002, which can be ignored. Also, as we increase the size of our training dataset, we can see that the F1 score of Support vector machine is inclined to be flat, and K-Nearest Neighbour's F1 score increases more when the size turn to 300, so maybe when we have a little more data, the F1 score of K-Nearest Neighbour will be the best. Therefore, we should choose K-Nearest Neighbour method for the trade-off between the accuracy and cost. Decision tree does not have advantage on both accuracy and cost. I think the school will prefer a model with relative satisfying accuracy and a rather low cost. Since K-Nearest Neighbour provides a competitive accuracy and a relative low cost. I think the school will like it. "

We simply measure the similarity of this new student and all the other students in the dataset by computing the distances between the new student's features and the other students' features. Then, we choose the most similar K(we can simply set K equals 5) students as our K nearest neighbours, and do a vote. If most of these K students passed, then we make the prediction that the new student does not need intervene. If most of these K students failed, then we make the prediction that the new student needs intervene. "
